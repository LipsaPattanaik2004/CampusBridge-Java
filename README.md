# CampusBridge-Java – OOP Student Management System
# Java | OOPS | Collections | File Handling | Persistence | Modular Architecture

## CampusBridge-Java is a fully implemented Object-Oriented Student Management System built using Java.
It demonstrates strong OOPS principles, modular design, CRUD operations, attendance tracking, and file-based persistence — making it ideal for learning, interviews, and product-based evaluations.

## Features
Create students & courses with unique IDs
Enroll students in multiple courses
Mark attendance per student per course
View detailed student profiles, including enrolled courses & attendance count
Full data persistence using Java serialization (students.dat, courses.dat)
Clean, modular code structure using models, services, and storage layers
Console-based interface for simple testing and demonstration
